This is hdf5 version 1.10.5.

Linux/Windows/macOS:
./configure --disable-hl --disable-shared --with-pic --with-zlib=no
make
make DESTDIR=<installation directory> install

NaoV5/V6:
./configure --disable-hl --disable-shared --with-zlib=no CFLAGS="-march=<atom/silvermont> -mtune=<atom/silvermont>"
make
make DESTDIR=<installation directory> install

Since the header file H5pubconf.h differs from platform to platform, I renamed
the respective original files to "H5pubconf<platform>.h" and created a wrapper
file which includes the correct version.
